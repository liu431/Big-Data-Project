AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).

Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by byteArray or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where byteArray is declared.

You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing...if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help me.

To force a GC, try (yes, twice):
flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();

I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of ""Monte-Carlo"" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes.

Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)

Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? record this fact.

Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.

Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. 

This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a monte carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods."

Try looking at Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and other well known PHP-based CMS's to see how their API hooks look and feel. This way you can even get ideas you may have not thought of previously to make things a little more rubust.

A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would ""include_once"" into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE ""hooks.php"" file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low. I.E fewer files for them to include."

For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.

This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.

Each time it is run, it gets information about the given table by using the system [INFORMATION_SCHEMA][1] tables, and records this data in the data repository. Compare the data returned regarding the structure of the table with the data returned the previous time. If it is different, then you know that the structure has changed.

Example query to return information regarding all of the columns in table ABC (ideally listing out just the columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table that you want, instead of using *select ** like I do here):

    select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'ABC'

""No longer used"" has more than one meaning, it could mean ""no more reference to it"", that is, totally unrecoverable, or it could mean, referenced, recoverable, unused but the program keeps the references anyway. Only the later applies to .Net for **perfectly managed objects**. However, not all classes are perfect and at some point an underlying unmanaged implementation could leak resources permanently for that process.

In all cases, the application consumes more memory than strictly needed. The sides effects, depending on the ammount leaked, could go from none, to slowdown caused by excessive collection, to a series of memory exceptions and finally a fatal error followed by forced process termination.

You know an application has a memory problem when monitoring shows that more and more memory is allocated to your process **after each garbage collection cycle**. In such case, you are either keeping too much in memory, or some underlying unmanaged implementation is leaking.

For most leaks, resources are recovered when the process is terminated, however some resources are not always recovered in some precise cases, GDI cursor handles are notorious for that. Of course, if you have an interprocess communication mechanism, memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates."

I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see [Pinning Artical][1]). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application.

I would also try and ensure the following:

a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) 
 
b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement)

The only time I would access a field directly is when the accessor has a lot of overhead.  It may feel like you're bloating your code unnecessarily, but it can certainly save a whole lot of headache in the future.  The classic example:

Later on, you may desire to change the way that field works.  Maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store.  If you are accessing properties directly, a change like that can break an awful lot of code in one swell foop."

Some ideas:

1. Build your own flash player (ew?)
2. Somehow draw over the youtube flash player. Will this work?
3. Reverse engineer & hijack youtube's annotation system. Either messing with the local files or redirecting it's attempt to download the annotations. (using greasemonkey? Firefox plugin?)

If you only need to store the database structure and not the data you can export the database as SQL queries. (in Enterprise Manager: Right click on database -> Generate SQL script. I recommend setting the ""create one file per object"" on the options tab) You can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn's diff and logging functions. 

I have this tied together with a Batch script that takes a couple parameters and sets up the database. I also added some additional queries that enter default data like user types and the admin user. (If you want more info on this, post something and I can put the script somewhere accessible)

If you need to keep all of the data as well, I recommend keeping a back up of the database and using Redgate (http://www.red-gate.com/) products to do the comparisons. They don't come cheap, but they are worth every penny."

That said, from everything I heard from our DBA, the key is to convert the database to 8.0 format first, and then go to 2005. I believe they used the built in migration/upgrade tools for this. There are some big steps between 6.5 and 8.0 that are better solved there than going from 6.5 to 2005 directly.

Your BIGGEST pain, if you didn't know already, is that DTS is gone in favor of SSIS. There is a shell type module that will run your existing DTS packages, but you're going to want to manually recreate them all in SSIS. Ease of this will depend on the complexity of the packages themselves, but I've done a few at work so far and they've been pretty smooth."

I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:

(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)

    //colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]
    colors = []; //holds final colors to be used
    rand = new Random();
    
    //assumes n is less than 16,777,216
    randomGen(int n){
       while (len(colors) < n){
          //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color
          newRed = rand.next(256);
          newGreen = rand.next(256);
          newBlue = rand.next(256);
          temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];
          //only adds new colors to the array
          if temp not in colors {
             colors.append(temp);
          }
       }
    }

One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:

    for item in color{
       itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);
       tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);
       dist = itemSq - tempSq;
       dist = abs(dist);
    }
    //NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.
    if dist < NUMBER and temp not in colors {
       colors.append(temp);
    }

But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.

Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example."

For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your Undead Minions gain +3 Attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As Trading Card Games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX Events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the Card needs.

If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.

That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .net Language to essentially be able to just fire the Event and let the Card manipulate the Gamestate in whatever way (within the Limits of the Code Access Security)."

In summary, signed is a good general choice - even when you're dead sure all the numbers are positive - if you're going to do arithmetic on the variable (like in a typical for loop case).  

If you're going to do bitwise things like masks, unsigned starts to make more sense.  Or, if you're desperate to get that extra positive range by taking advantage of the sign bit.

Personally, I like signed because I don't trust myself to stay consistent and avoid mixing the two types (like the article warns against).

Especially for small simple stuff, I like the event-driven theory of parsing rather than setting up a whole slew of callbacks for a relatively simple structure.  [Here is a good quick discussion of how to use the API][2].

What I like: you can handle the parsing in a `for` loop rather than using callbacks.  You also delay full parsing (the ""pull"" part) and only get additional detail when you call `expandNode()`.  This satisfies my general requirement for ""responsible"" efficiency without sacrificing ease of use and simplicity.

Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. It it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.

* When a new session starts, check for the existence of the id/value cookie and authenticate the new user if they match.

I choose not to put schema dumps in under version control as _alumb_ and others suggest because I want an easy way to upgrade my production database.

For a web application where I'll have a single production database instance, I use two techniques:

# Database Upgrade Scripts

A sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the DDL necessary to move the schema from version N to N+1.  (These go in your version control system.)  A _version_history_ table, something like

    create table VersionHistory (
        Version int primary key,
        UpgradeStart datetime not null,
        UpgradeEnd datetime
        );

gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version.

This ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once.  Again, these are **not** database dumps.  Rather, each script represents the **changes** necessary to move from one version to the next.  They're the script that you apply to your production database to ""upgrade"" it.

# Developer Sandbox Synchronization

1. A script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.  Run this after each upgrade to the production DB.
2. A script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation.  Each developer runs this script after each upgrade to the production DB.

    Integer i = new Integer(6);

You could call some method on i:

    String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i

Whereas with an int:

    int i = 6;

You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:

    String s = i.toString();//will not work!!!

would produce an error, because int is not an object.

int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).

I know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps!

In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:

  - On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).
  - On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.
  - Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.

The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB."

The struct is because you need to pass around a couple pieces of data.  The `gtk_idle_add()` call adds a method to be run when the main loop is running and idle, and the `FALSE` return value from the `display_dialog()` call means that it's only run once.  After we get the result from the dialog, we quit the main loop.  That'll cause the `gtk_main()` in your main `MessageBox()` method to return, and you'll be able to access the result from there.

As the answers mentioned, `int` is just a number (called the _unboxed_ type), whereas `Integer` is an object (which encloses the number, hence a _boxed_ type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on `int`), you cannot store `int` or other non-object types in collections (`List`, `Map`, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.

Java 5 onwards have something called _auto-boxing_ and _auto-unboxing_ which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:

    Deque<Integer> queue;

    void add(int n) {
        queue.add(n);
    }

    int remove() {
        return queue.remove();

Java 1.4 or earlier:

        queue.add(new Integer(n));
    }

    int remove() {
        return queue.remove().intValue();
    }

Auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because it means you don't have to think about writing out the boxing and unboxing by hand every time. However, these operations _do_ happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of them.

According to the page, the only difference is that a lambda is strict about the number of arguments it accepts, whereas Proc.new converts missing arguments to nil.  Here is an example IRB session illustrating the difference:

    irb(main):001:0> l = lambda { |x, y| x + y }
    => #<Proc:0x00007fc605ec0748@(irb):1>
    irb(main):002:0> p = Proc.new { |x, y| x + y }
    => #<Proc:0x00007fc605ea8698@(irb):2>
    irb(main):003:0> l.call ""hello"", ""world""
    => ""helloworld""
    irb(main):004:0> p.call ""hello"", ""world""
    => ""helloworld""
    irb(main):005:0> l.call ""hello""
    ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
     from (irb):1
     from (irb):5:in `call'

The page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior.  I agree with this sentiment.  Using a lambda seems a tad more concise, and with such an insignificant difference, it seems the better choice in the average situation.

As for Ruby 1.9, sorry, I haven't looked into 1.9 yet, but I don't imagine they would change it all that much (don't take my word for it though, it seems you have heard of some changes, so I am probably wrong there).

It turned out for me that creating (SOAP) XML documents is fairly simple, if you have a data structure that ""fits"" the schema.

I keep the envelope, since the response envelope is (almost) the same as the request envelope.  Then, since my data structure is a (possibly nested) dictionary, I create a string that turns this dictionary into &lt;key>value&lt;/key> items.  

This is a task that recursion makes simple, and I end up with the right structure.  This is all done in python code, and is currently fast enough for production use.

You can also (relatively) easily build lists as well, although depending upon your client, you may hit problems unless you give length hints.

For me, this was much simpler, since a dictionary is a much easier way of working than some custom class.  For the books, generating XML is much easier than parsing!"

As for automatically incrementing numbers, use the AssemblyInfo Task:

[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AssemblyInfoTaskvers][2]

This can be configured to automatically increment the build number.

2. Using with with Subversion requires a small change:

Retreiving the Version number is then quite easy:

    Version v = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version;
    string About = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, @""YourApp Version {0}.{1}.{2} (r{3})"", v.Major, v.Minor, v.Build, v.Revision);

>From Thomas Ptacek's blog:  
>Speed is exactly what you don’t want in a password hash function.
>
>Modern password schemes are attacked with incremental password crackers.
>
>Incremental crackers don’t precalculate all possible cracked passwords. They consider each password hash individually, and they feed their dictionary through the password hash function the same way your PHP login page would. Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.
>
>The password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run.
>
>The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars.

By default PHP stores the session data in a file in the OS's temp directory. Without any special thought or planning this is a world readable directory so all of your session information is public to anyone with access to the server.

As for maintaining sessions over multiple servers. At that point it would be better to switch PHP to user handled sessions where it calls your provided functions to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) the session data. At that point you could store the session information in a database or memcache like solution so that all application servers have access to the data.

Storing your own sessions may also be advantageous if you are on a shared server because it will let you store it in the database which you often times have more control over then the filesystem."

An alternative (since you asked) to updating the Unique Index values with different values would be to update all of the other values in the rows to that of the other row. Doing this means that you could leave the Unique Index values alone, and in the end, you end up with the data that you want. Be careful though, in case some other table references this table in a Foreign Key relationship, that all of the relationships in the DB remain intact."

We all pick (and I'm guilty of this too) MD5 or SHA1 because they are fast. Thinking about it ('cuz someone recently pointed it out to me) that doesn't make any sense. We should be picking a hashing algorithm that's stupid slow. I mean, on the scale of things, a busy site will hash passwords what? every 1/2 minute? Who cares if it take 0.8 seconds vs 0.03 seconds server wise? But that extra slowness is huge to prevent all types of common brute-forcish attacks.

From my reading, bcrypt is specifically designed for secure password hashing. It's based on blowfish, and there are many implementation.

Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying ""For item in list if criteria.matches"", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.

I'm going to crib an example from [Dive Into Python][1] here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.

>         files = os.listdir(path)                               
>         test = re.compile(""test\.py$"", re.IGNORECASE)          
>         files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]

You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.

  - In a `lambda`-created proc, the `return` statement returns only from the proc itself
  - In a `Proc.new`-created proc, the `return` statement is a little more surprising: it returns control not just from the proc, **but also from the method enclosing the proc!**

Here's `lambda`-created proc's `return` in action. It behaves in a way that you probably expect:

    def whowouldwin
    
      mylambda = lambda {return ""Freddy""}
      mylambda.call
    
      # mylambda gets called and returns ""Freddy"", and execution
      # continues on the next line

      return ""Jason""
    
    end


    whowouldwin
    => ""Jason""


Now here's a `Proc.new`-created proc's `return` doing the same thing. You're about to see one of those cases where Ruby breaks the much-vaunted Principle of Least Surprise:

    def whowouldwin2

      myproc = Proc.new {return ""Freddy""}
      myproc.call

      # myproc gets called and returns ""Freddy"", 
      # but also returns control from whowhouldwin2!
      # The line below *never* gets executed.

      return ""Jason""

    end


    whowouldwin2         
    => ""Freddy""

    #!/bin/python
    bar in dict(Foo)

Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the **<code>has_key()</code>** method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.

That should answer your question.

And now a little off topic to tie this in to the _list comprehension_ answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  _List Comprehensions_ construct a list from a basic _for loop_ with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:

Say you have a two dimensional dictionary **<code>foo</code>** and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key **<code>bar</code>**.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a _list comprehension_ with a conditional as follows:

    #!/bin/python
    baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])

Note the **<code>if bar in value</code>** at the end of the statement**, this is a modifying clause which tells the _list comprehension_ to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.**  In this case **<code>baz</code>** is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in [docs.python.org tutorials](http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000) and at [secnetix.de](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk), both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.)."

The example on the Python docs is quite straight forward:

So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then groupby() groups the data. You must be careful to **sort the data** by the criteria before you call groupby or it won't work. groupby method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group."

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to HKCU for every user on the computer. They need to be in the HKCU rather than HKLM because they are the default user settings, and do change per user. My feeling is that

 1. This isn't possible
 2. This isn't something the installer should be doing, but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).

With that in mind, I still want to change as little as possible in the application, so my question is, **is possible to add registry entries for every user in a Visual Studio 2003 setup project?** 

And, at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, and User/Machine Hive), I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhapes they could solve my problem above."

That's cool, I didn't know about that. Does it work in IE, etc?
From there you should be able to use JS to ajax, set cookies, whatever. I'd probably go the cookie route myself.

You'll need to allow the user to change it though. We tried to use geolocation (via maxmind) to do this a while ago, and it was wrong reasonably often - enough to make it not worth doing, so we just let the user set it in their profile, and show a notice to users who haven't set theirs yet."

Sure, if you're using a domain it's possible to have some stuff put in the registry on creation, but this is not really a use case. The Application should check if there are seetings and use the default settings if not.

That being said, it IS possible to change other users Keys through the HKEY_USERS Hive.

I have no experience with the Visual Studio 2003 Setup Project, so here is a bit of (totally unrelated) VBScript code that might just give you an idea where to look:

    strKeyPath = ""\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WinTrust\Trust Providers\Software Publishing""

The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.

With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.

With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.

This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.

Git seems to be the ""new, shiny, cool"" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the ""Distributed Source Control"" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.

If you need a change from someone else, though, she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her.

My own reasoning also makes me think DVCS makes things harder for QA and release management if you do things like centralized releases.  Someone has to be responsible for doing that push/pull from everyone else's repository, resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before, then doing the build, and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos.

All of this can be addressed with human processes, of course; DVCS just broke something that was fixed by centralized version control in order to provide some new conveniences."

If I'm developing a single project on my PC/laptop, git is better, because it is far easier to set up and use. 
You don't need a server, and you don't need to keep typing repository URL's in when you do merges.


If it were just 2 people, I'd say git is also easier, because you can just push and pull from eachother.

Once you get beyond that though, I'd go for subversion, because at that point you need to set up a 'dedicated' server or location. 

You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server. In SVN you just commit. In git you have to git commit, then git push. The additional step gets annoying simply because you end up doing it so much.

SVN also has the benefit of better GUI tools, however the git ecosystem seems to be catching up quickly, so I wouldn't worry about this in the long term."

> In PHP 5 there is a new Object Model. PHP's handling of objects has been completely rewritten, allowing for better performance and more features. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like primitive types (for instance integers and strings). The drawback of this method was that semantically the whole object was copied when a variable was assigned, or passed as a parameter to a method. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value (one can think of a handle as an object's identifier)."

We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations.  The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support.

If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later.  Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place.  Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized.

One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as

    String message = ""The "" + item + "" is on sale!"";
Instead, you must use something like

    String message = String.Format(""The {0} is on sale!"", item);

The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words."

I think in concept, you won't likely face any danger. Years of practice however tell me that you will always miss some object, permission, or other database item that won't manifest itself immediately. If you can script out the entire dump, the better as you will be less likely to miss something - and if you do miss something, it can be easily added to the script and fixed.

Making branches and merging between branches is really easy.

Even if you don't have commit rights for a project, you can still have your own repository online, and publish ""push requests"" for your patches. Everybody who likes your patches can pull them into their project, including the official maintainers.

It's trivial to fork a project, modify it, and still keep merging in the bugfixes from the HEAD branch. 

Git works for the linux kernel developers. That means it is really fast (it has to be), and scales to thousands of contributors. Git also uses less space (upto 30x less space for the Mozilla repository).

Git is very flexible, very TIMTOWTDI (There is more than one way to do it). You can use whatever workflow you want, and git will support it.

Finally, there's github, a great site for hosting your git repositories.

Drawbacks of git: 

 - it's much harder to learn, because git has more concepts and more commands.
 - revisions don't have version numbers like in subversion
 - many git commands are cryptic, and error messages are very user-unfriendly
 - it lacks a good GUI (such as the great TortoiseSVN)"

That's a good question... I think the code's ok.
From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,
and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.
Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead
(because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method
of timing.

Generally how it works is:

- declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the
optimizer will leave it alone).
- execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information
(which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer
so that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution.
- execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of
machine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit
value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.
Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every
5800 years or so.
- the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into
the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.

Specific notes:

- out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the
""cpuid"" instruction which in addition to giving you some information
about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.

- Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so
the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.

- The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you
probably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries.

- regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed
changes and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over
some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that
didn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.
(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)

- I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop,
although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an
AMD evaluation.

Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO)
under-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were
talking about whether or not a programmer should know C?  I was
shouting at them, ""hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler
is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is
doing!"""

When you have a database that uses a collation sequence that is different from default collation for the database server, you will need to take some extra precautions if you use temporary tables and/or table variables.  Temp tables/variables live in the tempdb database, which uses the collation seqyuence used by by the master databases.  Just remember to use ""COLLATE database_default"" when defining character fields in the temp tables/variables.  I [blogged about that][1] not too long ago, if you want some more details.

I also found the documentation regarding the E:

[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS][1]

> PostgreSQL also accepts ""escape"" string constants, which are an extension to the SQL standard. An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \\b is a backspace, \\f is a form feed, \\n is a newline, \\r is a carriage return, \\t is a tab. Also supported are \\digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \\xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \\', in addition to the normal way of ''.

Therefor, the following code:

    $aVar = ""test"";
    
    $aNewVar = $aVar;
    
    $aNewVar = ""newTest"";
    
    print ($aNewVar . "" "" . $aVar);

would output ""newTest test"", NOT ""newTest newTest"". If PHP where pass by reference, it would output ""newTest newTest"". You can pass by reference by doing the following:


    $aVar = ""test"";
    $aNewVar = $aVar;
    $bNewVar = &$aVar;
    $bNewVar = ""blah"";
    $cNewVar = &$aVar;

     print ($aVar . "" "" . $aNewVar . "" "" . $bNewVar . "" "" . $cNewVar);


The code would print out:

newest test newest newest

Because bNewVar and cNewVar are all just references back to aVar, whenever you change any one of them, all three are changed.

ffmpeg will guess at the bitrate you want, but if you'd like to specify one, you can use the -b option, so `-b 500000` is 500kbps for example.  There's a ton of options of course, but I generally get good results without much tinkering.  This is a good place to start if you're looking for more options: [video options][1].

You don't need a special web server to show flash video.  I've done just fine by simply pushing .flv files up to a standard web server, and linking to them with a good swf player, like [flowplayer][2].

WMVs are fine if you can be sure that all of your users will always use [a recent, up to date version of] Windows only, but even then, Flash is often a better fit for the web.  The player is even extremely skinnable and can be controlled with javascript.

Run it, use the Find Handle command (I think it's either in the find or handle menu), and search for the name of your file. Once the handle(s) is found, you can forcibly close them.

You can then delete the file and so on.

**Beware**, doing this may cause the program which owns the handles to behave strangely, as you've just pulled the proverbial rug out from under it, but it works well when you are debugging your own errant code, or when visual studio / windows explorer is being crap and not releasing file handles even though you told them to close the file ages ago... sigh :-)"

I just saw you are also looking for a means to load the content from a stream,

of course it will work, as the control will act as [a real browser window][1] (actually the internet explorer browser), but its not really meant to be used in the way you need it.

the second option is to use something I just discovered while looking for more information about plying flash content inside a windows form.

Although I did not test his code, it seems to show exactly what you want: a way to gain access to ViewState code while still on the server, before postback.

This means, by the time it is raised, your application is already on its way down the drain, and there is nothing you can do about it, except for doing cleanup and error logging.

What happened behind the scenes is this: The framework detected the exception, walked up the call stack to the very top, found no handlers that would recover from the error, so was unable to determine if it was safe to continue execution. So, it started the shutdown sequence, and fired up this event as a courtesy to you so you can pay your respects to your already-doomed process. This happens when an exception is left unhandled in the main thread.

There is no single-point solution to this kind of error. You need to put a real exception handler (a catch block) upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to (for example) a global handler method/class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue, based on exception type and/or content.

Edit: It is possible to disable (=hack) the error-reporting mechanism built into Windows so the mandatory ""crash and burn"" dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down. However, this becomes effective for *all* the applications in the system, not just your own."

Click Add Assembly and add your Assembly or Assemblies, add any .xml Documentation files (the ones generated by the compiler if you enabled that option) and then Build.

It will take some time, but the result **will** be worth the effort. It will actually look up stuff from MSDN, so your resulting documentation will also have the Class Inheritance all the way down to System.Object with links to MSDN and stuff.

Sandcastle seems a bit complicated at first, especially when you want to use it in an automated build, but I am absolutely sure it will be worth the effort.

Also have a look at [Sandcastle Help File Builder][1], this is a somewhat more advanced GUI for it.

If you tried to bundle it with your app, all the files (and images (and stylesheets (and ...) ) ) would make CHM look like a gift from gods.

That said, when actually bundled in the installation package, (instead of being served over the network), I found the CHM files to work nicely.

OTOH, another pitfall about CHM files: Even if you try to open a CHM file on a **local** disk, you may bump into the security block if you initially downloaded it from somewhere, because the file could be marked as ""came from external source"" when it was obtained."

Personally, I find CHM to be excellent.  One of the first things I do when setting up a machine is to download the PHP Manual in CHM format (<http://www.php.net/download-docs.php>) and add a hotkey to it in [Crimson Editor][1].  So when I press F1 it loads the CHM and performs a search for the word my cursor is on (great for quick function reference).
