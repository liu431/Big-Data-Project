<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).</p>

<p>Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by <code>byteArray</code> or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where <code>byteArray</code> is declared.</p>

<p>You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing... if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help it.</p>

<p>To force a GC, try (yes, twice):</p>

<p>I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of ""Monte-Carlo"" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes.</p>

<p>Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)</p>

<p>Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact.</p>

<p>Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.</p>

<p>Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. </p>

<p>This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.</p>

<p>This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.</p>

Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">T-SQL</a> commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQL&nbsp; Server</a>. The main part I need to be decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

<p>Basically, in <strong>.NET</strong> a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.</p>

<p>You'll know that you have leaks when you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (<strong>PerfMon</strong> has nice memory counters). </p>

<p>Understanding <strong>.NET</strong>'s memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work — again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the e-book. Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object <strong>A</strong> is registered to an event on object <strong>B</strong>, then object <strong>A</strong> will stick around until object <strong>B</strong> disappears because <strong>B</strong> holds a reference to <strong>A</strong>. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. </p>

<p>Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (<a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red-gate ants profile</a>, JetBrains dotMemory, <a href=""http://memprofiler.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">memprofiler</a> are really good choices, or you can use the text-only <strong>WinDbg</strong> and <strong>SOS</strong>, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).</p>

<p>I believe unmanaged code is subject to its typical memory leaks, except that shared references are managed by the garbage collector. I could be wrong about this last point.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

<p>Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:</p>

I have found this can happen in your application if you are using Windows API and COM (i.e. unmanaged code that has a bug in it or is not being managed correctly), in the framework and in third party components. I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue.</p>

<p>I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications.

<p>a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) </p>

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from <code>6.5</code> to <code>2005</code>?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading <code>6.5</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native <code>SQL Server</code> upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>'s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s standalone <code>""Import and Export Data""</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the <code>6.5 database</code> are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.</p>

<p>If you only need to store the database structure and not the data you can export the database as SQL queries. (in Enterprise Manager: Right click on database -> Generate SQL script.

<p>I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:</p>

<p>(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)</p>

<pre><code>//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]
colors = []; //holds final colors to be used
rand = new Random();

//assumes n is less than 16,777,216
randomGen(int n){
   while (len(colors) &lt; n){
      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color

      newGreen = rand.next(256);

      if temp not in colors {
         colors.append(temp);
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:</p>

<pre><code>for item in color{
   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);
   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);
   dist = itemSq - tempSq;
   dist = abs(dist);
}
//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.
if dist &lt; NUMBER and temp not in colors {
   colors.append(temp);
}

Interesting how these old questions resurface from time to time! How different the world is today and how dated this all seems.

<p>Migrations programatically define database transformations using a Ruby DSL; each transformation can be applied or (usually) rolled back, allowing you to jump to a different version of your DB schema at any given point in time.

<h3>Sending credentials</h3>

<p>The only practical way to send credentials 100% securely is by using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL"" rel=""noreferrer"">SSL</a>. Using JavaScript to hash the password is not safe. Common pitfalls for client-side password hashing:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the connection between the client and server is unencrypted, everything you do is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14907581/ssl-and-man-in-the-middle-misunderstanding"">vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks</a>. An attacker could replace the incoming javascript to break the hashing or send all credentials to their server, they could listen to client responses and impersonate the users perfectly, etc. etc. SSL with trusted Certificate Authorities is designed to prevent MitM attacks.</li>
<li>The hashed password received by the server is <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45254/owasp-recommendation-on-client-side-password-hashing"">less secure</a> if you don't do additional, redundant work on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's another secure method called <strong>SRP</strong>, but it's patented (although it is <a href=""http://srp.stanford.edu/license.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">freely licensed</a>) and there are few good implementations available.</p>

<h3>Storing passwords</h3>

<p>Don't ever store passwords as plaintext in the database. Not even if you don't care about the security of your own site. Assume that some of your users will reuse the password of their online bank account. So, store the hashed password, and throw away the original. And make sure the password doesn't show up in access logs or application logs. OWASP <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet#Impose_infeasible_verification_on_attacker"" rel=""noreferrer"">recommends the use of Argon2</a> as your first choice for new applications. If this is not available, PBKDF2 or scrypt should be used instead. And finally if none of the above are available, use bcrypt.</p>

<p>Hashes by themselves are also insecure. For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes--this makes hash lookup tables an effective way of cracking lots of passwords at once. Instead, store the <strong>salted</strong> hash. A salt is a string appended to the password prior to hashing - use a different (random) salt per user. The salt is a public value, so you can store them with the hash in the database. See <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/704865/Salted-Password-Hashing-Doing-it-Right"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> for more on this.</p>

<p>This means that you can't send the user their forgotten passwords (because you only have the hash). Don't reset the user's password unless you have authenticated the user (users must prove that they are able to read emails sent to the stored (and validated) email address.)</p>

<h3>Security questions</h3>

<p>Security questions are insecure - avoid using them. Why? Anything a security question does, a password does better. Read <strong><em>PART III: Using Secret Questions</em></strong> in <a href=""http://srp.stanford.edu/license.txt"" rel=""noreferrer"">@Jens Roland answer</a> here in this wiki.</p>

<h3>Session cookies</h3>

<p>After the user logs in, the server sends the user a session cookie. The server can retrieve the username or id from the cookie, but nobody else can generate such a cookie (TODO explain mechanisms).</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cookies can be hijacked</a>: they are only as secure as the rest of the client's machine and other communications. They can be read from disk, sniffed in network traffic, lifted by a cross-site scripting attack, phished from a poisoned DNS so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers. Don't send persistent cookies. Cookies should expire at the end of the client session (browser close or leaving your domain).</p>

<p>If you want to autologin your users, you can set a persistent cookie, but it should be distinct from a full-session cookie. You can set an additional flag that the user has auto-logged in, and needs to log in for real for sensitive operations. This is popular with shopping sites that want to provide you with a seamless, personalized shopping experience but still protect your financial details. For example, when you return to visit Amazon, they show you a page that looks like you're logged in, but when you go to place an order (or change your shipping address, credit card etc.), they ask you to confirm your password.</p>

<p>Financial websites such as banks and credit cards, on the other hand, only have sensitive data and should not allow auto-login or a low-security mode.</p>

568,2,,2008-08-02T22:05:08.093,146,,"<p>Well, in Java an int is a primitive while an Integer is an Object. Meaning, if you made a new Integer:</p>

<p>You could call some method on i:</p>

<pre><code>String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i

<p>Whereas with an int:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 6;

<p>You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:</p>

<p>int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).</p>

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li>
<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.

<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;

void add(int n) {
    queue.add(n);
}

int remove() {
    return queue.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

<pre><code>Deque queue;

void add(int n) {
    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));
}

int remove() {
    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Thomas Ptacek's blog:<br>
  Speed is exactly what you don’t want in a password hash function.</p>
  
  <p>Modern password schemes are attacked with incremental password crackers.</p>
  
  <p>Incremental crackers don’t precalculate all possible cracked passwords. They consider each password hash individually, and they feed their dictionary through the password hash function the same way your PHP login page would. Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.</p>
  
  <p>The password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run.</p>
  
  <p>The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars. </p>

<p>An alternative (since you asked) to updating the Unique Index values with different values would be to update all of the other values in the rows to that of the other row. Doing this means that you could leave the Unique Index values alone, and in the end, you end up with the data that you want. Be careful though, in case some other table references this table in a Foreign Key relationship, that all of the relationships in the DB remain intact.</p>

Thinking about it ('cuz someone recently pointed it out to me) that doesn't make any sense. We should be picking a hashing algorithm that's stupid slow. I mean, on the scale of things, a busy site will hash passwords what? every 1/2 minute? Who cares if it take 0.8 seconds vs 0.03 seconds server wise? But that extra slowness is huge to prevent all types of common brute-forcish attacks.</p>

If you use the <code>CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*))</code> method suggested by John, it will scan every row of the specified table.  The <code>NOLOCK</code> hint helps, but on a large database, you are still hitting every row.  You will also need to store the checksum for every row so that you tell one has changed.</p>

<p>Have you considered going at this from a different angle?  If you do not want to modify the schema to add triggers, (which makes a sense, it's not your database), have you considered working with the application vendor that does make the database?  </p>

<p>They could implement an API that provides a mechanism for notifying accessory apps that data has changed.  It could be as simple as writing to a notification table that lists what table and which row were modified.  That could be implemented through triggers or application code.  From your side, ti wouldn't matter, your only concern would be scanning the notification table on a periodic basis.  The performance hit on the database would be far less than scanning every row for changes.</p>

<p>The hard part would be convincing the application vendor to implement this feature.  Since this can be handles entirely through SQL via triggers, you could do the bulk of the work for them by writing and testing the triggers and then bringing the code to the application vendor.  By having the vendor support the triggers, it prevent the situation where your adding a trigger inadvertently replaces a trigger supplied by the vendor.</p>

701,2,,2008-08-03T14:30:50.850,7,,"<p>No, you were not dreaming.  Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying ""For item in list if criteria.matches"", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.</p>

<p>I'm going to crib an example from <a href=""http://diveintopython.net/functional_programming/filtering_lists.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dive Into Python</a> here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    files = os.listdir(path)                               
    test = re.compile(""test\.py$"", re.IGNORECASE)          
    files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python
bar in dict(Foo)

<p>Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>

<p>That should answer your question.</p>

<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a <em>list comprehension</em>:</p>

<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python
baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement**, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.**  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href=""http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href=""http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings, and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

<ol>
<li>This isn't possible</li>
<li>This isn't something the installer should be doing, but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).</li>
</ol>

<p>With that in mind, I still want to change as little as possible in the application, so my question is, <strong>is it possible to add registry entries for every user in a <code>Visual Studio 2003</code> setup project?</strong> </p>

<p>And, at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>, <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code>, <code>HKEY_USERS</code>, and User/Machine Hive). I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

<p>My algorithm, in Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>matrixOfSums list = [[a+b | b &lt;- list, b &gt;= a] | a &lt;- list]

sortedSums = foldl merge [] matrixOfSums

--A normal merge, save that we remove duplicates
merge xs [] = xs
merge [] ys = ys

<p>I found a minor improvement, one that's more amenable to lazy stream-based coding.  Instead of merging the columns pair-wise, merge all of them at once.  The advantage being that you start getting elements of the list immediately.</p>

<pre><code>-- wide-merge does a standard merge (ala merge-sort) across an arbitrary number of lists
-- wideNubMerge does this while eliminating duplicates
wideNubMerge :: Ord a =&gt; [[a]] -&gt; [a]
wideNubMerge ls = wideNubMerge1 $ filter (/= []) ls
wideNubMerge1 [] = []
wideNubMerge1 ls = mini:(wideNubMerge rest)
    where mini = minimum $ map head ls
          rest = map (dropWhile (== mini)) ls

betterSortedSums = wideNubMerge matrixOfSums

<p>However, if you know you're going to use all of the sums, and there's no advantage to getting some of them earlier, go with '<code>foldl merge []</code>', as it's faster.</p>

875,2,,2008-08-03T22:45:44.533,548,,"<p>Git is not better than Subversion. But is also not worse. It's different.</p>

<p>The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.</p>

<p>With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.</p>

<p>With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.</p>

<p>This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.</p>

<p>Git seems to be the ""new, shiny, cool"" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the ""Distributed Source Control"" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.</p>

<p>Subversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight.</p>

<p>First of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple ""svnadmin create"", Git's ""git init"" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the ""proper"" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the ""checkout"" command is very confusing to people changing over - the ""proper"" way seems to be ""git clone"", while ""git checkout"" seems to switch branches.</p>

<p>Git REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named ""origin"").</p>

<p>As said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with ""the server"" (I'm assuming most people still like a central ""master-repository"").</p>

<p>Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit.</p>

<p>SVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on.</p>

<p>Git has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).</p>

<p>This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic.</p>

<p>What I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN.</p>

<p>But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for ""Offline Source Control"" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.</p>

876,2,,2008-08-03T22:47:42.703,26,,"<p>Well, it's distributed. Benchmarks indicate that it's considerably faster (given its distributed nature, operations like diffs and logs are all local so of course it's blazingly faster in this case), and working folders are smaller (which still blows my mind).</p>

<p>When you're working on subversion, or any other client/server revision control system, you essentially create working copies on your machine by <em>checking-out</em> revisions. This represents a snapshot in time of what the repository looks like. You update your working copy via updates, and you update the repository via commits.</p>

<p>With a distributed version control, you don't have a snapshot, but rather the entire codebase. Wanna do a diff with a 3 month old version? No problem, the 3 month old version is still on your computer. This doesn't only mean things are way faster, but if you're disconnected from your central server, you can still do many of the operations you're used to. In other words, you don't just have a snapshot of a given revision, but the entire codebase.</p>

<p>You'd think that Git would take up a bunch of space on your harddrive, but from a couple benchmarks I've seen, it actually takes less. Don't ask me how. I mean, it was built by Linus, he knows a thing or two about filesystems I guess.</p>

<p>On the first step we start out with a list of numbers length n. For each number we need to create a list of length n-1 becuase we aren't adding a number to itself. By the end we have a list of about n sorted lists that was generated in O(n^2) time.</p>

<p>In step 2 because the lists were sorted by design (add a number to each element in a sorted list and the list will still be sorted) we can simply do a mergesort by merging each list together rather than mergesorting the whole lot.  In the end this should take O(n^2) time.</p>

create an empty list mergedlist
for each list templist in sumlist

  <p>In PHP 5 there is a new Object Model. PHP's handling of objects has been completely rewritten, allowing for better performance and more features. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like primitive types (for instance integers and strings). The drawback of this method was that semantically the whole object was copied when a variable was assigned, or passed as a parameter to a method. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value (one can think of a handle as an object's identifier).</p>

We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations.  The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support.</p>

<p>If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later.  Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place.  Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Having a PHP and MySQL Application that works well with German and French, but now needs to support Russian and Chinese. I think I move this over to .net, as PHP's Unicode support is - in my opinion - not really good. Sure, juggling around with utf8_de/encode or the mbstring-functions is fun. Almost as fun as having Freddy Krüger visit you at night...</p></li>
<li><p>Realizing that some languages are a LOT more Verbose than others. German is a LOT more verbose than English usually, and seeing how the German Version destroys the User Interface because too little space was allocated was not fun. Some products gained some fame for their creative ways to work around that, with Oblivion's ""Schw.Tr.d.Le.En.W."" being memorable :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Playing around with date formats, woohoo! Yes, there ARE actually people in the world who use date formats where the day goes in the middle. Sooooo much fun trying to find out what 07/02/2008 is supposed to mean, just because some users might believe it could be July 2... But then again, you guys over the pond may believe the same about users who put the month in the middle :-P, especially because in English, July 2 sounds a lot better than 2nd of July, something that does not neccessarily apply to other languages (i.e. in German, you would never say Juli 2 but always Zweiter Juli). I use 2008-02-07 whenever possible. It's clear that it means February 7 and it sorts properly, but dd/mm vs. mm/dd can be a really tricky problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Anoter fun thing, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192/floating-point-number-parsing-is-there-a-catch-all-algorithm"">Number formats</a>! 10.000,50 vs 10,000.50 vs. 10 000,50 vs. 10'000,50... This is my biggest nightmare right now, having to support a multi-cultural environent but not having any way to reliably know what number format the user will use.</p></li>
<li><p>Formal or Informal. In some language, there are two ways to address people, a formal way and a more informal way. In English, you just say ""You"", but in German you have to decide between the formal ""Sie"" and the informal ""Du"", same for French Tu/Vous. It's usually a safe bet to choose the formal way, but this is easily overlooked.</p></li>
<li><p>Calendars. In Europe, the first day of the Week is Monday, whereas in the US it's Sunday. Calendar Widgets are nice. Showing a Calendar with Sunday on the left and Saturday on the right to a European user is not so nice, it confuses them.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to admit, most of your example went straight over my head. It does compile, and seems to work, though. Is this safe for SMP systems or SpeedStep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a good question... I think the code's ok.
From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,
and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.
Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead
(because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method
of timing.</p>

<p>Generally how it works is:</p>

<ul>
<li>declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the
optimizer will leave it alone).</li>
<li>execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information
(which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer
so that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution.</li>
<li>execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of
machine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit
value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.
Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every
5800 years or so.</li>
<li>the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into
the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the
""cpuid"" instruction which in addition to giving you some information
about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so
the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you
probably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed
changes and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over
some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that
didn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.
(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop,
although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an
AMD evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO)
under-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were
talking about whether or not a programmer should know C?  I was
shouting at them, ""hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler
is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is
doing!""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PostgreSQL also accepts ""escape"" string constants, which are an extension to the SQL standard. An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \b is a backspace, \f is a form feed, \n is a newline, \r is a carriage return, \t is a tab. Also supported are \digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \', in addition to the normal way of ''.</p>

<p>I just saw you are also looking for a means to load the content from a stream,

<p>the first is the one I would advise you to use only when necessary, as it uses the full blown <strong>""webbrowser component""</strong> (also available as an extra toolbox item), which is like trying to shoot a fly with a bazooka.
of course it will work, as the control will act as <a href=""http://visualbasic.about.com/library/courses/blecvbsbs2202.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">a real browser window</a> (actually the internet explorer browser), but its not really meant to be used in the way you need it.</p>

<li>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</li>
<li>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</li>

<p>Essentially: the way to unlock a ""locked"" file is to inject a DLL file into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.</p>

1069,1,1073,2008-08-04T07:30:01.727,56,34585,"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<p>When data is stored on disk-based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data. These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn’t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires <code>N/2</code> block accesses (on average), where <code>N</code> is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn’t contain unique entries) then the entire tablespace must be searched at <code>N</code> block accesses.</p>

<p>Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, which has <code>log2 N</code> block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn’t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial.</p>

<p><strong>What is indexing?</strong></p>

<p>Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and a pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.</p>

<p>The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk since the indexes are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, let’s outline a sample database table schema; </p>

<pre>
Field name       Data type      Size on disk
id (Primary key) Unsigned INT   4 bytes
firstName        Char(50)       50 bytes
lastName         Char(50)       50 bytes
emailAddress     Char(100)      100 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. 
This sample database contains five million rows and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the <em>id</em> (a sorted key field) and one using the <em>firstName</em> (a non-key unsorted field).</p>

<p><strong><em>Example 1</em></strong> - <em>sorted vs unsorted fields</em></p>

<p>Given our sample database of <code>r = 5,000,000</code> records of a fixed size giving a record length of <code>R = 204</code> bytes and they are stored in a table using the MyISAM engine which is using the default block size <code>B = 1,024</code> bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be <code>bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5</code> records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is <code>N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000</code> blocks. </p>

<p>A linear search on the id field would require an average of <code>N/2 = 500,000</code> block accesses to find a value, given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted, a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of <code>log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20</code> block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement.</p>

<p>Now the <em>firstName</em> field is neither sorted nor a key field, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact <code>N = 1,000,000</code> block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct.</p>

<p>Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks than the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the <em>firstName</em> field is outlined below; </p>

<pre>
Field name       Data type      Size on disk
firstName        Char(50)       50 bytes
(record pointer) Special        4 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example 2</em></strong>  - <em>indexing</em></p>

<p>Given our sample database of <code>r = 5,000,000</code> records with an index record length of <code>R = 54</code> bytes and using the default block size <code>B = 1,024</code> bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be <code>bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18</code> records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the index is <code>N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778</code> blocks.</p>

<p>Now a search using the <em>firstName</em> field can utilize the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of <code>log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19</code> block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to <code>19 + 1 = 20</code> block accesses, a far cry from the 1,000,000 block accesses required to find a <em>firstName</em> match in the non-indexed table.</p>

<p><strong>When should it be used?</strong></p>

<p>Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example, a ~28% increase), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.</p>

<p>Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.</p>

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the ""No Setup, Just Extract and Run"" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>

<p>Well, though it has been a while since I used C/C++, realloc that grows only reuses the memory pointer value if there is room in memory after your original block.</p>

<p>For instance, consider this:</p>

<p>(xxxxxxxxxx..........)</p>

<p>If your pointer points to the first x, and . means free memory location, and you grow the memory size pointed to by your variable by 5 bytes, it'll succeed. This is of course a simplified example as blocks are rounded up to a certain size for alignment, but anyway.</p>

<p>However, if you subsequently try to grow it by another 10 bytes, and there is only 5 available, it will need to move the block in memory and update your pointer.</p>

<p>However, in your example you are passing the function a pointer to the character, not a pointer to your variable, and thus while the strrep function internally might be able to adjust the variable in use, it is a local variable to the strrep function and your calling code will be left with the original pointer variable value.</p>

<p>This pointer value, however, has been freed.</p>

<p>In your case, input is the culprit.</p>

<p>However, I would make another suggestion. In your case it looks like the <em>input</em> variable is indeed input, and if it is, it shouldn't be modified, at all.</p>

<p>I would thus try to find another way to do what you want to do, without changing <em>input</em>, as side-effects like this can be hard to track down.</p>

<p>Judging by your example, ""Property"", would you be better of with a class approach for the final level and real properties? Or is the names of the properties changing a lot from node to node?</p>

<p>I'd say that what ""efficient"" means depends on a lot of things, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>speed of updates (insert, update, delete)</li>
<li>speed of random access retrieval</li>
<li>speed of sequential retrieval</li>
<li>memory used</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that you'll find that a data structure that is speedy will generally consume more memory than one that is slow. This isn't always the case, but most data structures seems to follow this.</p>

<p>A dictionary might be easy to use, and give you relatively uniformly fast access, it will most likely use more memory than, as you suggest, lists. Lists, however, generally tend to contain more overhead when you insert data into it, unless they preallocate X nodes, in which they will again use more memory.</p>

<p>My suggestion, in general, would be to just use the method that seems the most natural to you, and then do a ""stress test"" of the system, adding a substantial amount of data to it and see if it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>You might also consider adding a layer of abstraction to your system, so that you don't have to change the programming interface if you later on need to change the internal data structure.</p>

Before you know it, you're testing for negative one all over the place and the compiler is complaining about how you're wanting to compare the menu selection against the number of menu selections you have - but that's dangerous because they're different types.
