AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).

Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by byteArray or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where byteArray is declared.

You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing...if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help me.

To force a GC, try (yes, twice):
flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();

    If Request.Form(""submitButton"") = ""Previous Page"" Then

I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of ""Monte-Carlo"" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes.

Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)

Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? record this fact.

Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.

Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. 

This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a monte carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods."

Try looking at Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and other well known PHP-based CMS's to see how their API hooks look and feel. This way you can even get ideas you may have not thought of previously to make things a little more rubust.

A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would ""include_once"" into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE ""hooks.php"" file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low.

**Notes:**

For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.

This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.

Compare the data returned regarding the structure of the table with the data returned the previous time. If it is different, then you know that the structure has changed.

Example query to return information regarding all of the columns in table ABC (ideally listing out just the columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table that you want, instead of using *select ** like I do here):

    select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'ABC'

You would monitor different columns and INFORMATION_SCHEMA views depending on how exactly you define ""changes to a table"".

The actual resolution of gettimeofday() depends on the hardware architecture. Intel processors as well as SPARC machines offer high resolution timers that measure microseconds. Other hardware architectures fall back to the system’s timer, which is typically set to 100 Hz. In such cases, the time resolution will be less accurate.

Perhaps ;)

Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:

PHP:

    public function getName() {
        $this->incrementNameCalled();
        return $this->_getName();
    }

    protected function _getName() {
        return $this->name;

and then from within the object itself:

PHP:

    $name = $this->_getName();

This way you can still use that first argument for something else (like sending a flag for whether or not to used cached data here perhaps)."

""No longer used"" has more than one meaning, it could mean ""no more reference to it"", that is, totally unrecoverable, or it could mean, referenced, recoverable, unused but the program keeps the references anyway. Only the later applies to .Net for **perfectly managed objects**. However, not all classes are perfect and at some point an underlying unmanaged implementation could leak resources permanently for that process.

In all cases, the application consumes more memory than strictly needed. The sides effects, depending on the ammount leaked, could go from none, to slowdown caused by excessive collection, to a series of memory exceptions and finally a fatal error followed by forced process termination.

You know an application has a memory problem when monitoring shows that more and more memory is allocated to your process **after each garbage collection cycle**. In such case, you are either keeping too much in memory, or some underlying unmanaged implementation is leaking.

For most leaks, resources are recovered when the process is terminated, however some resources are not always recovered in some precise cases, GDI cursor handles are notorious for that. Of course, if you have an interprocess communication mechanism, memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates."

I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue.

I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see [Pinning Artical][1]). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application.

I would also try and ensure the following:

a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) 
 
b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement)

c)If you are using unmanaged code/windows API's that these are dealt with correctly after. (some have clean up methods to release resources)

The only time I would access a field directly is when the accessor has a lot of overhead.  It may feel like you're bloating your code unnecessarily, but it can certainly save a whole lot of headache in the future.  The classic example:

Later on, you may desire to change the way that field works.  Maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store.  If you are accessing properties directly, a change like that can break an awful lot of code in one swell foop."

This consists of colored rectangles for each frame. The only requirement is that this be done programatically. Youtube has annotations now, but require you use their front end to create them by hand. I want to be able to generate them. What's the best way of doing this?

Some ideas:

1. Build your own flash player (ew?)
2. Somehow draw over the youtube flash player. Will this work?
3. Reverse engineer & hijack youtube's annotation system. Either messing with the local files or redirecting it's attempt to download the annotations. (using greasemonkey? Firefox plugin?)

Ideas that don't count: download the video, edit it, re-encode it, and upload it :P"

Converting a CSV file to XML doesn't add any value. Your program is already reading the CSV file, so arguing that you need XML doesn't work.

On the other hand, reading the CSV file, doing _something_ with the values, and then serializing to XML does make sense (well, as much as using XML can make sense... ;)) but you would supposedly already have a means of serializing to XML."

If you only need to store the database structure and not the data you can export the database as SQL queries. (in Enterprise Manager: Right click on database -> Generate SQL script. I recommend setting the ""create one file per object"" on the options tab) You can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn's diff and logging functions. 

I have this tied together with a Batch script that takes a couple parameters and sets up the database. I also added some additional queries that enter default data like user types and the admin user. (If you want more info on this, post something and I can put the script somewhere accessible)

If you need to keep all of the data as well, I recommend keeping a back up of the database and using Redgate (http://www.red-gate.com/) products to do the comparisons. They don't come cheap, but they are worth every penny."

That said, from everything I heard from our DBA, the key is to convert the database to 8.0 format first, and then go to 2005. I believe they used the built in migration/upgrade tools for this. There are some big steps between 6.5 and 8.0 that are better solved there than going from 6.5 to 2005 directly.

Your BIGGEST pain, if you didn't know already, is that DTS is gone in favor of SSIS. There is a shell type module that will run your existing DTS packages, but you're going to want to manually recreate them all in SSIS. Ease of this will depend on the complexity of the packages themselves, but I've done a few at work so far and they've been pretty smooth."

I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:

(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)

    //colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]
    colors = []; //holds final colors to be used
    rand = new Random();
    
    //assumes n is less than 16,777,216
    randomGen(int n){
       while (len(colors) < n){
          //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color
          newRed = rand.next(256);
          newGreen = rand.next(256);
          newBlue = rand.next(256);
          temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];
          //only adds new colors to the array
          if temp not in colors {
             colors.append(temp);
          }
       }
    }

One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:

    for item in color{
       itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);
       tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);
       dist = itemSq - tempSq;
       dist = abs(dist);
    }
    //NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.
    if dist < NUMBER and temp not in colors {
       colors.append(temp);
    }

But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.

Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example."

Essentially, they need to interact with my Gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your Undead Minions gain +3 Attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As Trading Card Games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX Events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the Card needs.

If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.

That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .net Language to essentially be able to just fire the Event and let the Card manipulate the Gamestate in whatever way (within the Limits of the Code Access Security)."

In summary, signed is a good general choice - even when you're dead sure all the numbers are positive - if you're going to do arithmetic on the variable (like in a typical for loop case).  

If you're going to do bitwise things like masks, unsigned starts to make more sense.  Or, if you're desperate to get that extra positive range by taking advantage of the sign bit.

Personally, I like signed because I don't trust myself to stay consistent and avoid mixing the two types (like the article warns against).

Especially for small simple stuff, I like the event-driven theory of parsing rather than setting up a whole slew of callbacks for a relatively simple structure.  [Here is a good quick discussion of how to use the API][2].

What I like: you can handle the parsing in a `for` loop rather than using callbacks.  You also delay full parsing (the ""pull"" part) and only get additional detail when you call `expandNode()`.  This satisfies my general requirement for ""responsible"" efficiency without sacrificing ease of use and simplicity.

Anyways, the idea behind the code is start with string of length 0, then keep track of all the strings of length Z where Z is the current size in the iteration.  Then, go through each string and append each character onto each string.  Finally at the end, remove any that were below the x threshold and return the result.

Thus, if 'object' is actually a List&lt;String&gt;, there will be no ClassCastException at runtime except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  This can cause further complications if items are added to the list with this incorrect generic type information.

Americans use 10,000.50, Germans use 10.000,50, French use 10 000,50 etc.
My first approach would be: Take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. The obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.
Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. It it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.

The obvious ""best solution"" would be to detect the User's culture or Browser, but that does not work if you have a Frenchman an an en-US Windows/Browser.

Although not dealing specifically with rails [this article][1] goes to some length to explain 'remember me' best practices.

In summary though you should:

* Add an extra column to the user table to accept a large random value
* Set a long lived cookie on the client which combines the user id and the random value
* When a new session starts, check for the existence of the id/value cookie and authenticate the new user if they match.

The author also recommends invalidating the random value and resetting the cookie at every login.  Personally I don't like that as you then can't stay logged into a site on two computers.  I would tend to make sure my password changing function also reset the random value thus locking out sessions on other machines. 

As a final note, the advice he gives on making certain functions (password change/email change etc) unavailable to auto authenticated sessions is well worth following but rarely seen in the real world.

I choose not to put schema dumps in under version control as _alumb_ and others suggest because I want an easy way to upgrade my production database.

For a web application where I'll have a single production database instance, I use two techniques:

# Database Upgrade Scripts

A sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the DDL necessary to move the schema from version N to N+1.  (These go in your version control system.)  A _version_history_ table, something like

    create table VersionHistory (
        Version int primary key,
        UpgradeStart datetime not null,
        UpgradeEnd datetime
        );

gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version.

This ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once.  Again, these are **not** database dumps.  Rather, each script represents the **changes** necessary to move from one version to the next.  They're the script that you apply to your production database to ""upgrade"" it.

# Developer Sandbox Synchronization

1. A script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.  Run this after each upgrade to the production DB.
2. A script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation.  Each developer runs this script after each upgrade to the production DB.

_A caveat: My automated tests run against a schema-correct but empty database, so this advice will not perfectly suit your needs._"

Because migrations are a part of [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.com/), they typically find use in full-stack Rails apps; however, you can use ActiveRecord independent of Rails with minimal effort. See [here](http://rails.aizatto.com/2007/05/27/activerecord-migrations-without-rails/) for a more detailed treatment of using AR's migrations outside of Rails."

    Integer i = new Integer(6);

You could call some method on i:

    String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i

Whereas with an int:

    int i = 6;

You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:

    String s = i.toString();//will not work!!!

would produce an error, because int is not an object.

int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).

I know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps!

In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:

  - On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).
  - On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.
  - Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.

The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB."

readability and performance is usually to use the built-in cursor iterator.

<pre>
curs.execute('select * from people')

</pre>

You can fetch all the rows into a list, but this can have some bad
side effects if the result set is large.

- You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
  your client process.

- You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
  the built-up list.

- It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the
  list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.

<pre>

Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at 
a time.  In general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over
using the iterator.  If there is something in your programming logic
that seems to indicate there is an advantage in doing this, perhaps
you should reconsider your programming logic.

The struct is because you need to pass around a couple pieces of data.  The `gtk_idle_add()` call adds a method to be run when the main loop is running and idle, and the `FALSE` return value from the `display_dialog()` call means that it's only run once.  After we get the result from the dialog, we quit the main loop.  That'll cause the `gtk_main()` in your main `MessageBox()` method to return, and you'll be able to access the result from there.

Hope this helps!"

You generate a migration file, which has rules to increase the db version (such as adding a column) and rules to downgrade the version (such as removing a column). Each migration is numbered, and a table keeps track of your db version.

To _migrate up_, you run a command called ""db:migrate"" which looks at your version and applies the needed scripts. You can migrate down in a similar way.

As the answers mentioned, `int` is just a number (called the _unboxed_ type), whereas `Integer` is an object (which encloses the number, hence a _boxed_ type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on `int`), you cannot store `int` or other non-object types in collections (`List`, `Map`, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.

Java 5 onwards have something called _auto-boxing_ and _auto-unboxing_ which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:

    Deque<Integer> queue;

    void add(int n) {
        queue.add(n);
    }

    int remove() {
        return queue.remove();
    }

Java 1.4 or earlier:

    Deque<Integer> queue;

    void add(int n) {
        queue.add(new Integer(n));
    }

    int remove() {
        return queue.remove().intValue();
    }

Auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because it means you don't have to think about writing out the boxing and unboxing by hand every time. However, these operations _do_ happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of them.

Hope this helps!"

According to the page, the only difference is that a lambda is strict about the number of arguments it accepts, whereas Proc.new converts missing arguments to nil.  Here is an example IRB session illustrating the difference:

    irb(main):001:0> l = lambda { |x, y| x + y }
    => #<Proc:0x00007fc605ec0748@(irb):1>
    irb(main):002:0> p = Proc.new { |x, y| x + y }

The page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior.  I agree with this sentiment.  Using a lambda seems a tad more concise, and with such an insignificant difference, it seems the better choice in the average situation.

As for Ruby 1.9, sorry, I haven't looked into 1.9 yet, but I don't imagine they would change it all that much (don't take my word for it though, it seems you have heard of some changes, so I am probably wrong there).

It turned out for me that creating (SOAP) XML documents is fairly simple, if you have a data structure that ""fits"" the schema.

I keep the envelope, since the response envelope is (almost) the same as the request envelope.  Then, since my data structure is a (possibly nested) dictionary, I create a string that turns this dictionary into &lt;key>value&lt;/key> items.  

This is a task that recursion makes simple, and I end up with the right structure.  This is all done in python code, and is currently fast enough for production use.

You can also (relatively) easily build lists as well, although depending upon your client, you may hit problems unless you give length hints.

For me, this was much simpler, since a dictionary is a much easier way of working than some custom class.  For the books, generating XML is much easier than parsing!"

As for automatically incrementing numbers, use the AssemblyInfo Task:

[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AssemblyInfoTaskvers][2]

This can be configured to automatically increment the build number.

There are 2 Gotchas:

1. Each of the 4 numbers in the Version string is limited to 65535. This is a Windows Limitation and unlikely to get fixed.

2. Using with with Subversion requires a small change:
 * [http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/archive/2006/08/29/4078.aspx][4]


Retreiving the Version number is then quite easy:

    Version v = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version;
    string About = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, @""YourApp Version {0}.{1}.{2} (r{3})"", v.Major, v.Minor, v.Build, v.Revision);

By default PHP stores the session data in a file in the OS's temp directory. Without any special thought or planning this is a world readable directory so all of your session information is public to anyone with access to the server.

As for maintaining sessions over multiple servers. At that point it would be better to switch PHP to user handled sessions where it calls your provided functions to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) the session data. At that point you could store the session information in a database or memcache like solution so that all application servers have access to the data.

Storing your own sessions may also be advantageous if you are on a shared server because it will let you store it in the database which you often times have more control over then the filesystem."

An alternative (since you asked) to updating the Unique Index values with different values would be to update all of the other values in the rows to that of the other row. Doing this means that you could leave the Unique Index values alone, and in the end, you end up with the data that you want. Be careful though, in case some other table references this table in a Foreign Key relationship, that all of the relationships in the DB remain intact."

We all pick (and I'm guilty of this too) MD5 or SHA1 because they are fast. Thinking about it ('cuz someone recently pointed it out to me) that doesn't make any sense. We should be picking a hashing algorithm that's stupid slow. I mean, on the scale of things, a busy site will hash passwords what? every 1/2 minute? Who cares if it take 0.8 seconds vs 0.03 seconds server wise? But that extra slowness is huge to prevent all types of common brute-forcish attacks.

From my reading, bcrypt is specifically designed for secure password hashing. It's based on blowfish, and there are many implementation.

Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying ""For item in list if criteria.matches"", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.

I'm going to crib an example from [Dive Into Python][1] here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.

>         files = os.listdir(path)                               
>         test = re.compile(""test\.py$"", re.IGNORECASE)          
>         files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]

You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.

  - In a `lambda`-created proc, the `return` statement returns only from the proc itself
  - In a `Proc.new`-created proc, the `return` statement is a little more surprising: it returns control not just from the proc, **but also from the method enclosing the proc!**

Here's `lambda`-created proc's `return` in action. It behaves in a way that you probably expect:

    def whowouldwin
    
      mylambda = lambda {return ""Freddy""}
      mylambda.call
    
      # mylambda gets called and returns ""Freddy"", and execution
      # continues on the next line

      return ""Jason""
    
    end


    whowouldwin
    => ""Jason""


Now here's a `Proc.new`-created proc's `return` doing the same thing. You're about to see one of those cases where Ruby breaks the much-vaunted Principle of Least Surprise:

    def whowouldwin2

      myproc = Proc.new {return ""Freddy""}
      myproc.call

      # myproc gets called and returns ""Freddy"", 
      # but also returns control from whowhouldwin2!
      # The line below *never* gets executed.

      return ""Jason""

    end


    whowouldwin2         
    => ""Freddy""

Thanks to this surprising behaviour (as well as less typing), I tend to favour using `lambda` over `Proc.new` when making procs."

    #!/bin/python
    bar in dict(Foo)

Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the **<code>has_key()</code>** method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.

That should answer your question.

And now a little off topic to tie this in to the _list comprehension_ answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  _List Comprehensions_ construct a list from a basic _for loop_ with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:

Say you have a two dimensional dictionary **<code>foo</code>** and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key **<code>bar</code>**.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a _list comprehension_ with a conditional as follows:

    #!/bin/python
    baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])

Note the **<code>if bar in value</code>** at the end of the statement**, this is a modifying clause which tells the _list comprehension_ to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.**  In this case **<code>baz</code>** is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in [docs.python.org tutorials](http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000) and at [secnetix.de](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk), both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.)."

  - DOB - 11/11/1934

Partition 0 would return a score of 0.345
Partition 1 would return a score of 0.337

Both matched exactly on the name and dob."

The example on the Python docs is quite straight forward:

        groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list

So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then groupby() groups the data. You must be careful to **sort the data** by the criteria before you call groupby or it won't work. groupby method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group."

Sure, if you're using a domain it's possible to have some stuff put in the registry on creation, but this is not really a use case. The Application should check if there are seetings and use the default settings if not.

That being said, it IS possible to change other users Keys through the HKEY_USERS Hive.

I have no experience with the Visual Studio 2003 Setup Project, so here is a bit of (totally unrelated) VBScript code that might just give you an idea where to look:

    const HKEY_USERS = &H80000003
    strComputer = "".""
    Set objReg=GetObject(""winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\"" & strComputer & ""\root\default:StdRegProv"")
    strKeyPath = """"
    objReg.EnumKey HKEY_USERS, strKeyPath, arrSubKeys
    strKeyPath = ""\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WinTrust\Trust Providers\Software Publishing""
    For Each subkey In arrSubKeys
        objReg.SetDWORDValue HKEY_USERS, subkey & strKeyPath, ""State"", 146944

The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.

With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.

With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.

This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.

Git seems to be the ""new, shiny, cool"" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the ""Distributed Source Control"" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.

If you need a change from someone else, though, she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her.

My own reasoning also makes me think DVCS makes things harder for QA and release management if you do things like centralized releases.  Someone has to be responsible for doing that push/pull from everyone else's repository, resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before, then doing the build, and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos.

All of this can be addressed with human processes, of course; DVCS just broke something that was fixed by centralized version control in order to provide some new conveniences."

If I'm developing a single project on my PC/laptop, git is better, because it is far easier to set up and use. 
You don't need a server, and you don't need to keep typing repository URL's in when you do merges.


If it were just 2 people, I'd say git is also easier, because you can just push and pull from eachother.

Once you get beyond that though, I'd go for subversion, because at that point you need to set up a 'dedicated' server or location. 

You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server. In SVN you just commit. In git you have to git commit, then git push. The additional step gets annoying simply because you end up doing it so much.

SVN also has the benefit of better GUI tools, however the git ecosystem seems to be catching up quickly, so I wouldn't worry about this in the long term."

We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations.  The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support.

If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later.  Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place.  Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized.

One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as

    String message = ""The "" + item + "" is on sale!"";
Instead, you must use something like

    String message = String.Format(""The {0} is on sale!"", item);

The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words."

I think in concept, you won't likely face any danger. Years of practice however tell me that you will always miss some object, permission, or other database item that won't manifest itself immediately. If you can script out the entire dump, the better as you will be less likely to miss something - and if you do miss something, it can be easily added to the script and fixed.

Making branches and merging between branches is really easy.

Even if you don't have commit rights for a project, you can still have your own repository online, and publish ""push requests"" for your patches. Everybody who likes your patches can pull them into their project, including the official maintainers.

It's trivial to fork a project, modify it, and still keep merging in the bugfixes from the HEAD branch. 

Git works for the linux kernel developers. That means it is really fast (it has to be), and scales to thousands of contributors. Git also uses less space (upto 30x less space for the Mozilla repository).

Git is very flexible, very TIMTOWTDI (There is more than one way to do it). You can use whatever workflow you want, and git will support it.

Finally, there's github, a great site for hosting your git repositories.

Drawbacks of git: 

 - it's much harder to learn, because git has more concepts and more commands.
 - revisions don't have version numbers like in subversion
 - many git commands are cryptic, and error messages are very user-unfriendly
 - it lacks a good GUI (such as the great TortoiseSVN)"

That's a good question... I think the code's ok.
From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,
and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.
Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead
(because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method
of timing.

Generally how it works is:

- declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the
optimizer will leave it alone).
- execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information
(which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer
so that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution.
- execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of
machine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit
value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.
Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every
5800 years or so.
- the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into
the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.

Specific notes:

- out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the
""cpuid"" instruction which in addition to giving you some information
about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.

- Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so
the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.

- The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you
probably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries.

- regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed
changes and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over
some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that
didn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.
(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)

- I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop,
although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an
AMD evaluation.

Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO)
under-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were
talking about whether or not a programmer should know C?  I was
shouting at them, ""hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler
is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is
doing!"""

An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \\b is a backspace, \\f is a form feed, \\n is a newline, \\r is a carriage return, \\t is a tab. Also supported are \\digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \\xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \\', in addition to the normal way of ''.

You can use one command to convert from just about any video format, ffmpeg is smart enough to figure the rest out, and it'll use every processor on your machine.  Invoking it is easy:

    ffmpeg -i input.avi output.flv

ffmpeg will guess at the bitrate you want, but if you'd like to specify one, you can use the -b option, so `-b 500000` is 500kbps for example.  There's a ton of options of course, but I generally get good results without much tinkering.  This is a good place to start if you're looking for more options: [video options][1].

You don't need a special web server to show flash video.  I've done just fine by simply pushing .flv files up to a standard web server, and linking to them with a good swf player, like [flowplayer][2].

WMVs are fine if you can be sure that all of your users will always use [a recent, up to date version of] Windows only, but even then, Flash is often a better fit for the web.  The player is even extremely skinnable and can be controlled with javascript.

You can then delete the file and so on.

**Beware**, doing this may cause the program which owns the handles to behave strangely, as you've just pulled the proverbial rug out from under it, but it works well when you are debugging your own errant code, or when visual studio / windows explorer is being crap and not releasing file handles even though you told them to close the file ages ago... sigh :-)"

I just saw you are also looking for a means to load the content from a stream,
and because I'm not really sure that is possible with the shockwave flash object I will give you another option (two actually).

the first is the one I would advise you to use only when necessary, as it uses the full blown **""webbrowser component""** (also available as an extra toolbox item), which is like trying to shoot a fly with a bazooka.
of course it will work, as the control will act as [a real browser window][1] (actually the internet explorer browser), but its not really meant to be used in the way you need it.

the second option is to use something I just discovered while looking for more information about plying flash content inside a windows form. [F-IN-BOX][2] is a commercial solution that will also play content from a given website URL. (The link provided will direct you to the .NET code you have to use).

In Visual studio on your toolbox, choose to add a new component.
Then in the new window that appears choose the **""COM Components""** tab to get a list in which you can find the **""Shockwave Flash Object""**

Once added to the toolbox, simply use the control as you would use any other ""standard"" control from visual studio.

three simple commands are available to interact with the control:

  - AxShockwaveFlash1.Stop()
  - AxShockwaveFlash1.Movie = FilePath &
    ""\FileName.swf""
  - AxShockwaveFlash1.Play()

which, I think, are all self explanatory.

This means, by the time it is raised, your application is already on its way down the drain, and there is nothing you can do about it, except for doing cleanup and error logging.

What happened behind the scenes is this: The framework detected the exception, walked up the call stack to the very top, found no handlers that would recover from the error, so was unable to determine if it was safe to continue execution. So, it started the shutdown sequence, and fired up this event as a courtesy to you so you can pay your respects to your already-doomed process. This happens when an exception is left unhandled in the main thread.

There is no single-point solution to this kind of error. You need to put a real exception handler (a catch block) upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to (for example) a global handler method/class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue, based on exception type and/or content.
